# Security Policy

## ⚖️ Responsible Use

SpecterScan is intended **only for authorized security testing and learning**.
Never scan systems or networks you do not own or have written permission to test.

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a bug or security issue in SpecterScan itself, please:

1. Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for sensitive findings.
2. Instead, email the maintainer at **[your.email@example.com]** or use GitHub Security Advisories.

I’ll review and address reports as quickly as possible.
