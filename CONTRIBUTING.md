# Contributing to SpecterScan

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## Ground Rules
1. **Ethical use only.** Never run scans on systems without written authorization.  
2. Keep features **non-destructive by default**.  
3. Follow the Python style guide (`flake8` or `black`).  
4. Document new options and update README.md.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
